We can rewrite the story
Tonight were forever young
Tonight were forever young
Through the pain and the heart ache
There's still love for everyone
There's still love for everyone
Hey would believe me if I said

We are here for a reason
Now this is our life
This is what counts
This is for us I would go anywhere for you
I would go anywhere for you yeah
I would go anywhere for you yeah

Ever know you were dreaming
Don't hide it from anyone
Don't hide it from anyone
Ever doubt what you're made of
There's a hero in everyone
There's a hero in everyone
Hey would you believe me if I said

We are here for a reason
Now this is our life
This is what counts
This is for us I would go anywhere for you
I would go anywhere for you yeah
I would go anywhere for you yeah
I would go anywhere for you yeah
Hold on tonight
For us I would go anywhere for you yeah
I would go anywhere for you yeah
